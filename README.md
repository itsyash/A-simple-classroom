# A-simple-classroom
A simple classroom application for IIIT.  

A pretty small web application that enables the following:

1) Professor should be able to start and stop the class session and put class details and other content.

2) Once the class is active, students should be able to register themselves through the student webpage. 
Behind this a validation should be present which will confirm whether a student's roll no exist in the course list. 
Fetch the student list from http://courses.iiit.ac.in

3) Once validated display the content to the student.

4) The content displayed to student should update in a real time.

Authentication thing is not working properly right now and I am in the process of fixing it.


Feel free to clone/test/fix bugs.

Cheers.
